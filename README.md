## Description


This site was created using bootstrap and html to create a site for displaying Angela's Organizer Website. The main page displays a nav containing the title, slogan, and some button options.


An "about me" modal can be reached from the "learn more" button. This tells all about who Angela is and contains her image and intro.


This contact page is the source for anyone viewing my portfolio to leave their contact info for me to review and reach out to them when ever they submit a contact request.
